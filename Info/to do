AI Life Calendar (working title)

⸻

1. Purpose & Vision

Purpose

AI Life Calendar is a web-based tool that transforms time (life, year, or goals) into a living, auto-updating lock‑screen wallpaper. It helps users feel time passing, not just track it.

Vision

To become the most emotionally impactful, minimalist time-awareness product — without requiring a mobile app.

Core idea: Time → Visual → Emotion → Action

3. Solution Overview
